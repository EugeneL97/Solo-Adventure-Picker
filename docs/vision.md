# Solo Adventure Picker - Vision Document

## Purpose
The Solo Adventure Picker transforms real-life exploration into a gamified experience. Inspired by systems from World of Warcraft, it encourages users to treat their life like an adventure RPG. The app rewards exploration, mindfulness, and spontaneity while helping users break out of routine and unlock new experiences.

## Core Narrative (Details WIP)
In a world where the veil between Earth and a forgotten fantasy realm has begun to thin, adventurers are being called from among everyday people. You are one of them. The map is shrouded in mystery, but as you venture into parks, cafes, scenic trails, and hidden local gems, the fog lifts. Echoes of a parallel realm awaken with each step.

Your journeys earn you experience, awaken your character's latent traits, and bring gear and knowledge from the forgotten realm into this one. Journal your travels. Level up. Unlock your path.

## MVP Feature Goals
- Randomized adventure suggestions with optional filters (region, type)
- Basic user authentication system
- XP system tied to completing adventures, journaling, and mindful reflection
- Fog of war map that uncovers as users visit new locations
- Achievements for milestones (e.g., "First Hike", "5 Food Stops")
- Reroll button with limited uses (restored via quests or achievements)

## Gamification Systems
- **XP & Leveling:** Users gain XP by completing adventures and submitting journals. Leveling unlocks achievements, perks, and possibly regions.
- **Achievements:** Milestone rewards such as streaks, unique activity types, exploration diversity, or writing depth.
- **Gear System (future):** Cosmetic or perk-based gear (e.g., "Explorer's Boots" that give bonus XP for hikes).
- **Daily / Weekly Quests:** Daily / Weekly tasks to encourage routine engagement (e.g., "Visit somewhere within 10 miles" or "Write a reflection").
- **Reroll Economy:** Limited rerolls per day. More gained via achievements, daily quests, or pay-to-unlock.
- **Zone Locking (Optional):** Higher-level zones or challenges unlocked with experience or self-reported skill level.

---

## Exploration Mechanics
- **Fog of War Map:** Grid or real map that reveals visited regions. Earn exploration achievements.
- **Filtering System:** Lets users customize suggestions without removing spontaneity.
- **Quick Find (LFG):** A simple, fast suggestion based on 1-2 key preferences.

---

## Mindfulness Integration
- **Journaling XP:** Users earn XP by reflecting on adventures.
- **Prompted Reflection:** Could include guided journaling with prompts for check-ins or insights.
- **Optional Streak Rewards:** To build consistent self-reflection habits.

## Stretch Features
- GPS-based randomness (especially on mobile)
- Google Places integration for deeper local discovery
- Budget-awareness (distance, estimated costs)
- Social elements: shared maps, leaderboards, friend lists
- Tutorial intro sequence like an MMO starting zone
- Mobile PWA or native app port
- Monetization: cosmetic unlocks, reroll packs, or premium perks

---

## Design Principles
- Design for usefulness, deliver through fun
- Encourage curiosity, courage, and self-discovery
- Limit exploitability while preserving freedom
- Make the user feel like their life is a game worth playing

## Notes for Future Iteration
- Storyline can evolve based on feedback and imagination
- Additional archetypes could shape experience paths (Explorer, Foodie, Nomad, Philosopher)
- Keep system modular and open-ended to support future community features or expansions
